## Description
My motivation for creating this React portfolio is to showcase my skills and experience as a web developer and to provide potential employers with a clear and compelling overview of my work samples. I built this React portfolio project to demonstrate my proficiency in using React and to create a professional and polished online presence that showcases my web development projects and skills. This React portfolio project solves the problem of effectively and efficiently presenting my web development work samples to potential employers, providing them with a user-friendly and informative platform to assess my skills and experience. Through building this React portfolio project, I gained valuable experience in creating reusable components, working with React hooks and state management, and deploying a React application to GitHub Pages.
